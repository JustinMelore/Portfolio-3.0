                In the Wake of Betrayal is a Biblical action game that mixes fast-paced directional combat with wave defense gameplay. As you progress through
                the stages of Hell, Earth, and Heaven, you must fight off waves of enemy demons who are trying to kill you and destory your ship. Combat puts
                an emphasis on timing with a parrying mechanic that can stun enemies and deflect projectiles, as well as a directional dodge which goes through
                enemy attacks.

                As one of our team's two engineers, my work was mostly focused on gameplay programming. Player movement and dodging, as well as the player's combat
                mechanics like attacking and parrying, were all mechanics designed and programmed by me. I also helped plan out the behavior for the game's different
                enemy types, though implementation mostly rested on the shoulders of our other engineeer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond gameplay programming, I also had a hand in designing and implementing other core gameplay systems needed for the game to function. Some notable
                examples of this would be the ship's health system, our point-based wave system which randomly generated enemy waves, and our enemy spawner which utilized
                the tiles in our ship's tilemap to create dynamic spawn points rather than relying on set spawn positions.
