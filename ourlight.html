                Though the world may be darkened and corrupted by loneliness, a simple act of kindness can bring light to a gloomy world. As you face the challenges 
                and puzzles of life, remember that kindness can be returned. Our Light is a puzzle game that plays into the theme of sharing your light.

                In Our Light, the player travels through a gloomy landscape using the special light from their lantern to overcome obstacles, such as creating
                bridges of light to cross gaps or clearing out dense fog. However, your light is limited, and if you do not use it carefully, you will succumb
                to the darkness around you. Luckily, you do not have to go alone, as there are others you can meet who will help share your burden if you share
                your light with them.

                As the sole engineer for this project, I was responsible for designing all of the mechanics and systems that went into the game. By extension,
                I was also responsible for all of the implementation/coding of those systems and mechanics. Additionally, since most of the remaining members of
                our team had very little programming experience, it was also my job to ensure that our systems were as easily modifiable and intuitive as possible
                so as to allow our designers to make any necessary tweaks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the most notable mechanics I worked on for this project were the player's toggleable cone of light, the puzzle obstacles that 
                interacted with said light, and the light resource system that depleted or refreshed depending on player actions.
